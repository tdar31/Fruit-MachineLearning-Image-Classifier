Trained CNN that does image classification for various types of fruits.  Simply upload a photo to return a result

Model currently has a ~82% success rate identifying the correct fruit using current training data. Current dataset are ~200 images per class taken from Google Images.

Current classes: Apple, Apricot, Avocado, Banana, Blackberry, Blueberry, Cantaloupe, Cherry, Cloudberry, Coconut, Cucumber, Date, Dragonfruit, Durian, Fig, Grape, Grapefruit, Honeyberry, Honeydew, Kiwifruit, Kumquat, Lemon, Lime, Mango, Orange, Papaya, Passionfruit, Peach, Pear, Plum, Pineapple, Pomegranante, Raspberry, Strawberry and Watermelon

Notable issues with the current model

- Certain fruits that are very close in appearence (i.e Kumquat and Orange)

- Fruits that come in different shades of color (i.e Green Apples and Red Apples)

- Differentiating fruits that have been cut open versus pre harvested state (i.e unopened Honeydew and Cantaloupe versus when they are cut open)
